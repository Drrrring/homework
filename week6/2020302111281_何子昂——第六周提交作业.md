**The 1s complement is obtained by converting all the 0s to 1s and converting all the 1s to 0s.  At the receiver, all four 16-bit words are added, including the checksum. If no errors are introduced into the packet, then clearly the sum at the receiver will be 1111111111111111. If one of the bits is a 0, then we know that errors have been introduced into the packet**
