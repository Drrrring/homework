## **Homework 5**
1. **UDP and TCP use 1s complement for their checksums. Suppose you have the following three 8-bit bytes: 01010011, 01100110, 01110100. What is the 1s complement of the sum of these 8-bit bytes? (Note that although UDP and TCP use 16-bit words in computing the checksum, for this problem you are being asked to consider 8-bit sums.) Show all work. Why is it that UDP takes the 1s complement of the sum; that is, why not just use the sum? With the 1s complement scheme, how does the receiver detect errors? Is it possible that a 1-bit error will go undetected? How about a 2-bit error?**  

**01010011 + 01100110 + 01110100 = 00101110**  ===》The 1s complement of the sum of these 8-bit bytes is 11010001. If UDP takes the 1s complement of the sum, the receiver can sum up the checksum and the sum of the data it receives. If the sum contains a zero, the receiver knows there has been an error. All one-bit errors will be detected, but two-bit errors can be undetected as there may be 01+10 and 11+00.
