>  <strong>P3</strong> .UDP and TCP use 1s complement for their checksums. Suppose you have 
the following three 8-bit bytes: 01010011, 01100110, 01110100. <br>What is the 
1s complement of the sum of these 8-bit bytes? (Note that although UDP and 
TCP use 16-bit words in computing the checksum, for this problem you are 
being asked to consider 8-bit sums.) Show all work. <br>Why is it that UDP takes 
the 1s complement of the sum; that is, why not just use the sum? <br>With the 1s 
complement scheme, how does the receiver detect errors?<br> Is it possible that a 
1-bit error will go undetected? <br>How about a 2-bit error?

<strong>
01010011 + 01100110 = 10111001<br>
10111001 + 01110100 = 00101110<br>
Radix-minus-one complement of 11010001<br>
The verification is simple. You only need to add up all the data and the verification code to determine whether all bits are 1<br>
If not all 1s, there is a transmission error.<br>
A 1-bit error can definitely be detected, while a 2-bit error can't be detected (two bits are reversed simultaneously).

><strong>P8</strong>. Draw the FSM for the receiver side of protocol rdt3.0.

<strong>
![rdt3.0接收方](https://github.com/laichidigua/homework/blob/main/week6/rdt.jpg)

rdt3.0发送方添加了计时器，可以解决丢包问题，在这个机制中接收方只需要发送相应包的ACK（出错了发上一个包的ACK）即可，丢包问题的解决和重复报文的解决都在发送端，即rdt3.0的接收端和rdt2.2一样
