#### P <u>3</u>

<font color="gray">UDP and TCP use 1s complement for their checksums. Suppose you have  the following three 8-bit bytes: 01010011, 01100110, 01110100.  Is it possible that a  1-bit error will go undetected? How about a 2-bit error? </font>

<font color="gray">a. What is the  1s complement of the sum of these 8-bit bytes? (Note that although UDP and  TCP use 16-bit words in computing the checksum, for this problem you are  being asked to consider 8-bit sums.) Show all work. </font>

​			01010011

​			01100110

​	<u>+      01110100</u>    

​			00101101      carry out=1

sum plus carry out=00101110

checksum=11010001

<font color="gray"> b. Why is it that UDP takes  the 1s complement of the sum; that is, why not just use the sum? With the 1s  complement scheme, how does the receiver detect errors?</font>

  With checksum in 1's complement form, there won't be a error no matter the receiver use LSB first or LSB last. Check result will be the same for two types of computers.

  The receiver can simply add all data and checksum and compare the result to 11111111, if they are equal, then this transportation can pass the check.



<font color="gray"> c.   Is it possible that a  1-bit error will go undetected? How about a 2-bit error? </font>

1. Impossible. As long as 1-bit error error emerges, checksum will be different to the original.
2. Possible. With 2-bit error, checksum will possibly remain the same. For example 11111111 and 00000000 become 11111110 and 00000001 in error.
