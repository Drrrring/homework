a . Maybe k-4 , k-3 , k-2 , k-1  
Because the receiver requests the k, the packet before k has been sent.  
And the sender window is 4, so k-1 , k-2 , k-3 , k-4 may appear in the window.  
---
b . All [k-4 , k-1] groups may be possible values of ACK fields.  
Because of request k, all packets before K must be successfully received.  
If these returned information is on the link, it must be the ACK field.

a . True . Consider the case of overtime retransmission.  
The packet may be retransmitted many times due to timeout, and multiple acks may be obtained.  
The timeout ack may be received by the sender later, but there is no serial number in the window when it arrives.  
---
b . True . The same reason of the a.  
---
c . True . When the window length is 1, the window size functions of SR, GBN and alternating protocol are the same.  
The window size of 1 excludes the possibility of unordered grouping, and the cumulative ack is an ordinary ack.  
Because it can only refer to a single group within the window.  
---
d . True . The same reason of the c.

a . L(max) = 2^32 Byte.  
---
b . header : (2^32)/536 = 8012999 Byte  
All the header : 8012999 * 66 = 528857934  
All the byte : 2^32 + 528857934 = 4.824 * 10^9  
The time : T = (4.824 * 10^9) * 8/(155 * 10^6) = 249 s .
