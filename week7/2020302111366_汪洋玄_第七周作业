[k,k+3]

[k-1,k+2]

[k-2,k+1]

[k-3,k]

[k-4,k-1]

form k-4 to k-1 , they may not receive the ACK from the receiver.

#### b)

from k-5 to k-1

As the receiver is expecting has a sequence number of k, then from k-4 to k-1 packets have been sent ,then the value of ACK can't be less than k-5 . So it's from k-5 to k-1



### P24

#### a)

True  . ACKs from receiver may receive late after the window changes , and the ACK may be less than the current window.

#### b)

True.  It's the same as a)

#### c)

True .They all only send one packet at one time and wait for the ACK.

#### d)

True . It's the same as c)



### P26

#### a)

$2^{32}$=4294967296 

It's about 4.19Gbytes

#### b)

The number of segments is $2^{32}$ / 536 = 8012999.

The total number of bytes transmitted is  4.824*$10^9$bytes.

So it would take 249 s to transmit the file over the link.
