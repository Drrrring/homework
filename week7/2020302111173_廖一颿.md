P22.

a) We know that the sender's window is either [k, k+N-1] (if the receiver has received all the k-1 packages and sends the ACK) or [k-N, k-1] (if the sender doesn't receive any ACK). For the latter case, the sender's window contains k-1 and the N packets up to and including k-1. So it's [k-N, k-1]. And so we can arrive at the result that the sender's window is of 3 size and is from k-N to k.



b)Cause the sender has receive the k-N-1 packet with ACK, and the receiver is waiting for the kth packet, we can be sure of the arrange of [k-N-1, k-1].



P24

a)True.

b)True.

c)False.

d)True.





P26

a) $2^{32}\ = \ 4,294,967,296 \ \approx\ 4.19 GB$

b) $\dfrac{2^{32}}{536} \times 66B\ +\ 2^{32}\ =\ 4.824 \times 10^9$
