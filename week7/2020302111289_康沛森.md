>  <strong>P22</strong> Consider the GBN protocol with a sender window size of 4 and a sequence 
number range of 1,024. <br>Suppose that at time t, the next in-order packet 
that the receiver is expecting has a sequence number of k.<br> Assume that the 
medium does not reorder messages.<br> Answer the following questions:<br>
a. What are the possible sets of sequence numbers inside the sender’s 
window at time t? Justify your answer.<br>
b. What are all possible values of the ACK field in all possible messages 
currently propagating back to the sender at time t? Justify your answer.<br><br>
<strong>
a:考虑两个极端，第一个此时窗口为k-4, k-3, k-2, k-1：原因是发送方发送了前四个包，接收方发回的ACK一个也没有接收到<br>
第二个极端窗口为k, k+1, k+2, k+3，发送方发送了后四个包，但接收方还未收到<br><br>
b:考虑一个极端，假设发送的第一个包即K-5发生了问题，比如超时，ACK或者包丢失，就导致发送方重新发送K-5后的四个包，此时接受的ACK依次是k-5, k-4, k-3, k-2, k-1 <br>
</strong>

><strong>P24</strong>.Answer true or false to the following questions and briefly justify your 
answer:<br>
a. With the SR protocol, it is possible for the sender to receive an ACK for a 
packet that falls outside of its current window.<br>
b. With GBN, it is possible for the sender to receive an ACK for a packet 
that falls outside of its current window.<br>
c. The alternating-bit protocol is the same as the SR protocol with a sender 
and receiver window size of 1.<br>
d. The alternating-bit protocol is the same as the GBN protocol with a sender 
and receiver window size of 1.<br><br>

<strong>
a：可能，比如窗口为三，发送端发送1,2,3包后还未接收到各自包的ACK就进行了超时重传，这时候最开始的1,2,3包的ACK也到达，窗口变成4,5,6包，这时第二次重传的三个包的ACK也返回，但落在了窗口之外
<br><br>
b：可能，窗口为2，发送端发送了1,2包，接收端也返回了1,2包的ACK，但还未到达时发送端就对1包进行了超时重传，这时候1,2包的ACK也到达，窗口挪为3,4包，这时重传的1包的ACK也到达，但落在的窗口之外<br><br>
c：正确，只有一个包，就都相当于等停<br><br>
d：正确，同理

><strong>P26</strong>Consider transferring an enormous file of L bytes from Host A to Host B. <br>
Assume an MSS of 536 bytes.<br>
a. What is the maximum value of L such that TCP sequence numbers are not 
exhausted? Recall that the TCP sequence number field has 4 bytes.<br>
b. For the L you obtain in (a), find how long it takes to transmit the file. <br>
Assume that a total of 66 bytes of transport, network, and data-link header 
are added to each segment before the resulting packet is sent out over a 
155 Mbps link. <br>Ignore flow control and congestion control so A can pump 
out the segments back to back and continuously.<br><br>
     
<strong>
a：MSS大小只是限定报文的大小，但对总传输量不限制，故此处可以忽略MSS，因为四个字节，TCP序号循环用，故一个循环是2的32次方个，对应约为4.2Gb个字节<br><br>
b:报文数 2<sup>32</sup> / 536 ~= 8,012,999  
(2<sup>32</sup> + 66 * 8,012,999) * 8  / 155 * 1024<sup>2</sup> ~= 237s
