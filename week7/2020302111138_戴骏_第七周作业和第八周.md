# week 7 homework
## Problem 22
suppose  that receiver have received the k-1 packet ,and have returned all the ACKs then the set of sequence number will be [k, k+N-1],suppose that none of the ACKs have been received by the sender ,then the sequence number set is [k-N,k-1],so the sequence number set is [k-N,k+N-1]
## Problem 24
a.True, suppose there have sender window size=3 and send packet1,2,3 at t0,and receiver return ACK1,2,3 but the time out and receiver send the packet1,2,3 again at t1, but at t2 it receive the ACK1,2,3 and window move and receiver send packet4,5,6 and it receive the ACK1,2,3 which receiver send the second time 
b.True ,this will happen at the same scenario as a
c.True
d.True.when the window size =1 ,the SR,alternating-protocol and the GBN protocol are the same.
## Problem 26
a.the maxsize file can be transfered from A to B is 2'32 =4.19Gbytes
b.the number of segments from A send to B is [2'32/536]=8012999 then it totally transmitted the 2'32+66*8012999
bytes and it needs  about 250 seconds to transmit

## Problem 40
a.the interval of time when slow start is operating is 6 seconds(0-----6 seconds the segment grow up in exponential growth
b.the 6------16s is tcp congenstion avoidence
c.it is segment loss detected by a triple duplicate ACK because the window size become half of it origin size
d.it is by a time out,because the window become 1 suddenly

## Problem 44

a.it take 12-6+1 RTT:7 RTT to increase from 6 to 12
b.5+6+7+8+9+10/6=7.5MSS/RTT
