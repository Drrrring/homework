#### P 1

<font color="gray">Consider the network below. </font>

<font color="gray">a. Show the forwarding table in router A, such that all traffic destined to host  H3 is forwarded through interface 3.</font>

<table>
    <th>destnation</th>
    <th>interface</th>
    <tr>
        <td>H3</td>
        <td>3</td>
    </tr>
</table>



<font color="gray">b. Can you write down a forwarding table in router A, such that all traffic from H1 destined to host H3 is forwarded through interface 3, while all  traffic from H2 destined to host H3 is forwarded through interface 4?</font>

No. A forwarding table can only determine which interface to forward depending on its destination rather than its source.



#### P 4

<font color="gray"> Consider the switch shown below. Suppose that all datagrams have the same  fixed length, that the switch operates in a slotted, synchronous manner, and  that in one time slot a datagram can be transferred from an input port to an  output port. The switch fabric is a crossbar so that at most one datagram can  be transferred to a given output port in a time slot, but different output ports  can receive datagrams from different input ports in a single time slot. </font>

<font color="gray"> What is  the minimal number of time slots needed to transfer the packets shown from  input ports to their output ports, assuming any input queue scheduling order  you want (i.e., it need not have HOL blocking)?</font>

3.

1. X in the first input queue and Y in the second input queue are processed.
2. X in the second input queue and Y in the third input queue are processed.
3. Z in the third input queue is processed.

<font color="gray">What is the largest number  of slots needed, assuming the worst-case scheduling order you can devise,  assuming that a non-empty input queue is never idle?</font>

3. Because a non-empty input queue is never idle.
