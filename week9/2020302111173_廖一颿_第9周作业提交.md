Week 9 | chapter 4  -  P1, P4, P6, P9

P1

a)

| Destination | Link Interface |
| :---------: | :------------: |
|     H3      |       3        |

All traffic destined to host H3 is forwarded through interface 3.

b)

No. Because we can't write down a forwarding table in a router, it's tased on destination address.



P4

The minimal number of time slots needed to transfer the packets shown from inputs to thier outputs is 3.

Slot 1: send X in the top input queue, send Y in middle input queue.    

Slot 2: send X in middle input queue, send Y in bottom input queue.

Slot 3: send Z in bottom input queue. 

The largest number is 4.



P6

a) Their leaving time is t = 2, 3, 4, 6, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 respectively.

​	Delay time is 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3.

​	$(1+1+2+...+3)/12=11/6.$

b)The queue is t = 1, 2 , 2 , 4, 3. , 4, 6. , 6, 8. , 9, 9.  respectively.

​	The leaving time is 2,4,3,6,5,7,8,9,10,12,11 respectively.

​	So the delay time is 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2.

​	The average delay is 23/12.
