> b. Can you write down a forwarding table in router A, such that all traffic from H1 destined to host H3 is forwarded through interface 3, while all  traffic from H2 destined to host H3 is forwarded through interface 4?  (Hint: This is a trick question.)

a. 

| Destination | Link Interface |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| Host H3     | 3              |

b. No. Because there is no such thing as which interface will be forwarded through is based on sender. It is determined by the destination.

> P4. Consider the switch shown below. Suppose that all datagrams have the same  fixed length, that the switch operates in a slotted, synchronous manner, and  that in one time slot a datagram can be transferred from an input port to an  output port. The switch fabric is a crossbar so that at most one datagram can  be transferred to a given output port in a time slot, but different output ports  can receive datagrams from different input ports in a single time slot. What is  the minimal number of time slots needed to transfer the packets shown from  input ports to their output ports, assuming any input queue scheduling order  you want (i.e., it need not have HOL blocking)? What is the largest number  of slots needed, assuming the worst-case scheduling order you can devise,  assuming that a non-empty input queue is never idle?

The minimal number of time slots is 3.

Slot 1: send X in the first input queue, send Y in the second input queue.

Slot 2: send X in the second input queue, send Y in the third input queue.

Slot 3: send Z in the third input queue.

The largest number of time slots is 3.

Because a non-empty input queue is never idle, in Slot 1, X in the first input queue will be sent, and Y in either second or third input queue will be sent. In Slot 2, the datagrams in the second queue and third queue are different, so two datagrams will be sent. In Slot 3, the last datagram will be sent.

> P6. Consider the figure below. Answer the following questions:
>
> a. Assuming FIFO service, indicate the time at which packets 2 through  12 each leave the queue. For each packet, what is the delay between its  arrival and the beginning of the slot in which it is transmitted? What is the  average of this delay over all 12 packets? 
>
> b. Now assume a priority service, and assume that odd-numbered packets  are high priority, and even-numbered packets are low priority. Indicate the  time at which packets 2 through 12 each leave the queue. For each packet,  what is the delay between its arrival and the beginning of the slot in which  it is transmitted? What is the average of this delay over all 12 packets? 
>
> c. Now assume round robin service. Assume that packets 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, and  12 are from class 1, and packets 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are from class 2.  Indicate the time at which packets 2 through 12 each leave the queue. For  each packet, what is the delay between its arrival and its departure? What  is the average delay over all 12 packets? 
>
> d. Now assume weighted fair queueing (WFQ) service. Assume that odd-numbered packets are from class 1, and even-numbered packets are from  class 2. Class 1 has a WFQ weight of 2, while class 2 has a WFQ weight  of 1. Note that it may not be possible to achieve an idealized WFQ schedule as described in the text, so indicate why you have chosen the particular packet to go into service at each time slot. For each packet what is the  delay between its arrival and its departure? What is the average delay over  all 12 packets? 
>
> e. What do you notice about the average delay in all four cases (FIFO, RR,  priority, and WFQ)?

a. 

| Packet | Arrival | Leaving time | Delay Time |

| 1      | 0       | 0            | 0          |

| 12     | 8       | 11           | 3          |

The  average of this delay over all 12 packets = (0+1+1+2+2+2+3+2+3+2+2+3)/12 = 1.92

| 12     | 8       | 11           | 3          |

Because Class 1 has a WFQ weight of 2, while class 2 has a WFQ weight  of 1, 2 packets of class 1 leave in a turn and then 1 packet of class 2 leaves in next turn.

the average delay over  all 12 packets = (0+2+0+4+0+5+1+4+1+3+0+3)/12 = 1.92



e. 

The average delay in all four cases are equal.
