# Homework of week 9

## Chapter 4, P1

*Consider the network below.  
a. Show the forwarding table in router A, such that all traffic destined to
host H3 is forwarded through interface 3.  
b. Can you write down a forwarding table in router A, such that all traffic
from H1 destined to host H3 is forwarded through interface 3, while all
traffic from H2 destined to host H3 is forwarded through interface 4?*

Answer:  
A. Forwarding table shown below:

|header|output|
|-|-|
|H3|3|

B.  
That is impossible.

## Chapter 4, P4

*Consider the switch shown below. Suppose that all datagrams have the same
fixed length, that the switch operates in a slotted, synchronous manner, and
that in one time slot a datagram can be transferred from an input port to an
output port. The switch fabric is a crossbar so that at most one datagram can
be transferred to a given output port in a time slot, but different output
ports can receive datagrams from different input ports in a single time
slot. What is the minimal number of time slots needed to transfer the
packets shown from input ports to their output ports, assuming any input
queue scheduling order you want (i.e., it need not have HOL blocking)? What
is the largest number of slots needed, assuming the worst-case scheduling
order you can devise, assuming that a non-empty input queue is never idle?*

Answer:  
Minimum amount of time slots is 3. Consider the packets whose destination is
Y in input #2 and #3, only one of then can be transferred at T = 1. The
remaining will require 2 time slots to transfer.
Shown below:  

|T|Send|
|-|-|
|1|#1 X, #2 Y|
|2|#2 X, #3 Y|
|3|#3 Z|

The worst-case is also 3, the situation is the same as analyzed above.

7|10|8|2
8|11 / 12|9|3
9|/|10|2
10|/|11|2

2|6|/|2 / 4 / 6|2|2
3|5 / 7|5 / 7|4 / 6|5|0
4|/|7|4 / 6|7|1
5|8 / 9|9|4 / 6 / 8|9|0
6|/|/|4 / 6 / 8|4|5
7|10|/|6 / 8 / 10|6|5
8|11 / 12|11|8 / 10 / 12|11|0
9|/|/|8 / 10 / 12|8|4
10|/|/|10 / 12|10|3
11|/|/|12|12|3

Average delay: 1.917 time slots.

### C. Round Robin Service

T|Arrival|Class 1 Queue|Class 2 Queue|Serving|Depart|Delay
-|-|-|-|-|-|-
0|1 / 2|1 / 2|/|1|1|0
1|3 / 4|2 / 3|4|2|4|0
2|6|2 / 3 / 6|/|1|2|2
3|5 / 7|3 / 6|5 / 7|2|5|0
4|/|3 / 6|7|1|3|3
5|8 / 9|6|7 / 8 / 9|2|7|2
6|/|6|8 / 9|1|6|4
7|10|/|8 / 9 / 10|2|8|2
8|11 / 12|11 / 12|9 / 10|1|11|0
9|/|12|9 / 10|2|9|4
10|/|12|10|1|12|2
11|/|/|10|2|10|4

Average delay: 1.917 time slots.

### D. Weighted Fair Queue Service

T|Arrival|Depart|Delay
-|-|-|-
0|1 / 2|1|0
1|3 / 4|3|0
2|6|2|2
3|5 / 7|5|0
4|/|7|1
5|8 / 9|4|4
6|/|9|1
7|10|6|5
8|11 / 12|11|0
9|/|8|4
10|/|10|3
11|/|12|3

Average delay: 1.917 time slots.

### E. Conclusion

Despite the delay of each packet differs, but the average delay remains the
same (1.917 time slots).
