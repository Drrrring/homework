#### Solution

a)

| Destination Address | Link Interface |
| :-----------------: | :------------: |
|        $H3$         |      $3$       |

b)	No, because forwarding rule is only based on destination address.

1. The minimal number of time solts needed is $3$. The scheduling is as follows:
   - Slot $1$ : send $X$ in top input queue, send $Y$ in middle input queue.
   - Slot $2$ : send $X$ in middle input queue, send $Y$ in bottom input queue.
   - Slot $3$ : send $Z$ in bottom input queue.
2. The largest number of slots is $3$. In the first time slot, always sending $X$ in the top input queue and sending $Y$ in either middle or bottom input queue. In the second time slot, we can always send two more datagram. In the third time slot, the last datagram can be sent.

a) The time at which packets $2$ through $12$ each leave the queue. So, the packet that entered the queue first(arrival time), leaves the queue first(leaving time) for the FIFO service. The following table is used to calculate the delay between its arrival and the beginning of the slot in which it is transmitted by using given figure:

| Packet | Arrival time | Leaving time | Delay time |
| :----: | :----------: | :----------: | :--------: |
|   1    |      0       |      0       |     0      |
|   2    |      0       |      1       |     1      |
|   3    |      1       |      2       |     1      |
|   4    |      1       |      3       |     2      |
|   5    |      3       |      5       |     2      |
|   6    |      2       |      4       |     2      |
|   7    |      3       |      6       |     3      |
|   8    |      5       |      7       |     2      |
|   9    |      5       |      8       |     3      |
|   10   |      7       |      9       |     2      |
|   11   |      8       |      10      |     2      |
|   12   |      8       |      11      |     3      |

The average of this delay over all $12$ packets $=\frac{0+1+1+2+2+2+3+2+3+2+2+3}{12}=1.92$



b) Assume that odd-numbered$(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11) $packets are high priority and even-numbered$(2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 ) $packets are low priority. So, the packet with higher priority is transmitted before the packet with lower priority for priority queuse service. The following table data is used to calculate the delay between its arrival and the beginning of the slot in which it is transmitted by using given figure:

| Packet | Arrival time | Leaving time | Delay time |
| :----: | :----------: | :----------: | :--------: |
|   1    |      0       |      0       |     0      |
|   2    |      0       |      2       |     2      |
|   3    |      1       |      1       |     0      |
|   4    |      1       |      6       |     5      |
|   5    |      3       |      4       |     1      |
|   6    |      2       |      7       |     5      |
|   7    |      3       |      3       |     0      |
|   8    |      5       |      9       |     4      |
|   9    |      5       |      5       |     0      |
|   10   |      7       |      10      |     3      |
|   11   |      8       |      8       |     0      |
|   12   |      8       |      11      |     3      |

The average of this delay over all $12$ packets $=\frac{0+2+0+5+5+1+0+4+0+3+0+3}{12}=1.92$



c) Assume that packets $1, 2, 3, 6, 11, and 12$ are from class $1$, and packets $4, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10$ are from class $2$ as a packet of each class leaves the queue alternatively in a round robin service.The following table data is used to calculate the delay between its arrival and the beginning of the slot in which it is transmitted by using given figure:

| Packet | Arrival time | Leaving time | Delay time |
| :----: | :----------: | :----------: | :--------: |
|   1    |      0       |      0       |     0      |
|   2    |      0       |      2       |     2      |
|   3    |      1       |      4       |     3      |
|   4    |      1       |      1       |     0      |
|   5    |      3       |      3       |     0      |
|   6    |      2       |      6       |     4      |
|   7    |      3       |      5       |     2      |
|   8    |      5       |      7       |     2      |
|   9    |      5       |      9       |     4      |
|   10   |      7       |      11      |     4      |
|   11   |      8       |      8       |     0      |
|   12   |      8       |      12      |     2      |

The average of this delay over all $12$ packets $=\frac{0+2+3+0+0+4+2+2+4+4+0+2}{12}=1.92$



d) Assume that odd- numbered packets$(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 )$ are from class $1$, and even-numbered packets$(2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 )$ are from class $2$ as $2$ packets of class $1$ leaves in a turn and then the turn comes to class $2$ and only one packet may leave in one turn. The following table data is used to calculate the delay between its arrival and the beginning of the slot in which it is transmitted by using given figure:

| Packet | Arrival time | Leaving time | Delay time |
| :----: | :----------: | :----------: | :--------: |
|   1    |      0       |      0       |     0      |
|   2    |      0       |      2       |     2      |
|   3    |      1       |      1       |     0      |
|   4    |      1       |      5       |     4      |
|   5    |      3       |      3       |     0      |
|   6    |      2       |      7       |     5      |
|   7    |      3       |      4       |     1      |
|   8    |      5       |      9       |     4      |
|   9    |      5       |      6       |     1      |
|   10   |      7       |      10      |     3      |
|   11   |      8       |      8       |     0      |
|   12   |      8       |      11      |     3      |

The average of this delay over all $12$ packets $=\frac{0+2+0+4+0+5+1+4+1+3+0+3}{12}=1.92$



e) The average delay over all $12$ packets values are equal, but the delays of the packet values are different for FIFO, RR, priority, and WFQ.
