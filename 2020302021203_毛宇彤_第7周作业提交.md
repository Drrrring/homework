P22. Consider the GBN protocol with a sender window size of 4 and a sequence number range of 1,024. Suppose that at time t, the next in-order packet that the receiver is expecting has a sequence number of k. Assume that the medium does not reorder messages. Answer the following questions:
a. What are the possible sets of sequence numbers inside the senderâ€™s window at time t? Justify your answer.

> The package Seq=k is among the current window, can be the any of the 4 number.
>
> 1. [k, k+3]
> 2. [k-1,k+2]
> 3. [k-2,k+1]
> 4. [k-3,k]

b. What are all possible values of the ACK field in all possible messages currently propagating back to the sender at time t? Justify your answer.

>[k-3,k]



P24. Answer true or false to the following questions and briefly justify your answer:
a. With the SR protocol, it is possible for the sender to receive an ACK for a packet that falls outside of its current window.

> True. assume window's size is 4
>
> $t_1$:1,2,3,4 were sent from sender
>
> $t_2$:1,2,3,4 were received by receiver
>
> [timeout]
>
> $t_3$:1,2,3,4 were resent from sender
>
> $t_4$: the first 1,2,3,4's ACK arrived at sender, window advanced to 5,6,7,8
>
> $t_5$:the second 1,2,3,4's ACK arrived, but now window is at 5,6,7,8

b. With GBN, it is possible for the sender to receive an ACK for a packet that falls outside of its current window.

> True. The same as above

c. The alternating-bit protocol is the same as the SR protocol with a sender and receiver window size of 1.

> True.

d. The alternating-bit protocol is the same as the GBN protocol with a sender and receiver window size of 1.

> True.



P26. Consider transferring an enormous file of L bytes from Host A to Host B. Assume an MSS of 536 bytes.
a. What is the maximum value of L such that TCP sequence numbers are not exhausted? Recall that the TCP sequence number field has 4 bytes.

> $2^{32}$

b. For the L you obtain in (a), find how long it takes to transmit the file. Assume that a total of 66 bytes of transport, network, and data-link header are added to each segment before the resulting packet is sent out over a 155 Mbps link. Ignore flow control and congestion control so A can pump out the segments back to back and continuously.

> segment's number: $2^{32}/536=8012999$
>
> $\frac{8012999\times(536+66)\times8}{155\times2^{20}}=247.68s$
