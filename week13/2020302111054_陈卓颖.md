Chapter 5

- P12.

  Describe how loops in paths can be detected in BGP.

- Solution:

  If a router sees its own AS is contained in the AS-PATH, it knows there is a loop and rejects the advertisement.

  

- P16.

  Consider the following network. ISP B provides national backbone service to regional ISP A. ISP C provides  national backbone service to regional ISP D. Each ISP consists of one AS. B and C peer with each other in two places using BGP. Consider traffic going from A to D. B would prefer to hand that traffic over to C on the West Coast (so that C would have to absorb the cost of carrying the traffic cross-country), while C would prefer to get the traffic via its East Coast peering point with B (so that B would have carried the traffic across the country). What BGP mechanism might C use, so that B would hand over A-to-D traffic at its East Coast peering point? To answer this question, you will need to dig into the BGP specification.

- Solution:

  C can only advertise its route to D via its east coast peering point with C.

  

- P20.

  Suppose ASs X and Z are not directly connected but instead are connected by AS Y. Further suppose that X has a peering agreement with Y, and that Y has a peering agreement with Z. Finally, suppose that Z wants to transit all of Y’s traffic but does not want to transit X’s traffic. Does BGP allow Z to implement this policy?

- Solution:

  Yes. It's possible that Z does not advertise path ASZ, ASY to ASX.

  

- p22.

  In Section 5.7, we saw that it was preferable to transport SNMP messages in unreliable UDP datagrams. Why do you think the  designers of SNMP chose UDP rather than TCP as the transport protocol of choice for SNMP?

- Solution:

  Because there is not connection in UDP, it is faster to send message and more efficient.
