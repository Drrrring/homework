P40

a) The interval is **[1,6] and [23,26]**. We can learn that form the smoother curve.

b) **[6,16] and [17,22]**.We can learn that form the straight line.

c) It's detected by **a triple duplicate ACK**. Cause if there is a timeout, the TCP window size will decrease to 1.

d) It's detected by **a timeout**. For reason resented in c).

e) It's **about 32**. Cause after this window size, the slow start stops.

f) **21.** When packet loss is detected (which happens in 16th round), the threshold is half of the value(it's around 42), so the value of *ssthresh* is 21.

g) **14.** The packet loss is detected when the vale of window size is about 28 in the 22th round, so the *ssthresh* is half of it, which is 14.

h) **7th.** In the first 6 round, there has been around 1+2+4+7+16+32=62 packets sent, and the 7th round, there is 33 packets to be sent, which contains the 70th packet.

i)**4 and 7**. When packet losses, the threshold will be set to half of the current value, which is half of around 8. And the new values of the threshold will be 4 + 3 = 7.

j)**21. 1.**

k)**52.** 1+2+4+8+16+21=52.





P44

a. **6RTTs**.

b. **8.5 MSS/RTT**. $\dfrac{1}{6} \times (6+7+8+9+10+11) = 8.5 \dfrac{MSS}{RTT}$
