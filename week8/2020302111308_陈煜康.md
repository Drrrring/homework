#### P 40

<font color="gray">Consider Figure 3.61. Assuming TCP Reno is the protocol experiencing the  behavior shown above, answer the following questions. In all cases, you  should provide a short discussion justifying your answer. </font>

a. 1~6, 23~26, in these periods, the window size increases in an exponential way.

b. 6~15, 17~22, in these periods, the window size increases in a linear way.

c. triple duplicate ACK, CWND didn't decrease to 1.

d. timeout, CWND decreased to 1.

e. 32. When CWND reached 32, it increases linearly then,

f. 21. When congestion was detected for the last time , cwnd was 42.

g. 17. When congestion was detected for the last time , cwnd was 34.

h. 7. 1+2+4+8+16+32<70<1+2+4+8+16+32+64

i. ssthresh=4, cwnd=7

j. ssthresh=4, cwnd=4

k. 52. from 17~21,slow starts, cwnd are 1,2,4,8,16, and 22th reached ssthresh  cwnd is 21.





#### P 44

<font color="gray">Consider sending a large file from a host to another over a TCP connection  that has no loss.</font>

<font color="gray"> a. Suppose TCP uses AIMD for its congestion control without slow start.  Assuming cwnd increases by 1 MSS every time a batch of ACKs is  received and assuming approximately constant round-trip times, how long  does it take for cwnd increase from 6 MSS to 12 MSS (assuming no loss  events)?</font>

6 RTT, 1 RTT is needed for a group of ACKs to be received and thus cwnd increases by 1.



<font color="gray"> b. What is the average throughput (in terms of MSS and RTT) for this connection up through time = 6 RTT?</font>

total MSS: 6+7+8+9+10+11=51.

average throughput=51/6=8.5 MSS/RTT
