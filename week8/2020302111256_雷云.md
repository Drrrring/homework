### Chapter 3 Problem 40

+ **question:**

    Consider Figure 3.61. Assuming TCP Reno is the protocol experiencing the behavior shown above, answer the following questions. In all cases, you should provide a short discussion justifying your answer.

    + a. Identify the intervals of time when TCP slow start is operating.
    + b. Identify the intervals of time when TCP congestion avoidance is operating.
    + c. After the 16th transmission round, is segment loss detected by a triple duplicate ACK or by a timeout?
    + d. After the 22nd transmission round, is segment loss detected by a triple duplicate ACK or by a timeout?
    + e. What is the initial value of ssthresh at the first transmission round?
    + f. What is the value of ssthresh at the 18th transmission round?
    + g. What is the value of ssthresh at the 24th transmission round?
    + h. During what transmission round is the 70th segment sent?
    + i. Assuming a packet loss is detected after the 26th round by the receipt of a triple duplicate ACK, what will be the values of the congestion window size and of ssthresh?
    + j. Suppose TCP Tahoe is used (instead of TCP Reno), and assume that triple duplicate ACKs are received at the 16th round. What are the ssthresh and the congestion window size at the 19th round?
    + k. Again suppose TCP Tahoe is used, and there is a timeout event at 22nd round. How many packets have been sent out from 17th round till 22nd round, inclusive?

+ **Answer:**
    + a. [1,6] and [23,26] transmission round is the intervals of time when TCP slow start is operating. 
        Because, in the **slow-start** state, the value of cwnd begins at 1 MSS and increases by 1 MSS every time a transmitted segment is first acknowledged. So, the cwnd is increase exponentially by a factor of 2. Namely, the value of cwnd is the double of last transmission round.
    + b. [6,16] and [17,22] transmission round is the intervals of time when TCP congestion avoidance is operating. Because, in the **congestion avoidance** state, the value of cwnd the increases the value of cwnd by just a single MSS every RTT.
    + c. By a triple duplicate ACK, because at 17th transmission round the cwnd dropped to the half of the last cwnd, instead of 1.
    + d. By a timeout, because at 23th transmission round the cwnd dropped to 1.
    + e. The initial value of ssthresh is 32. Because when cwnd is 32, the state transferred from slow start to congestion avoidance.
    + f. 21 is the value of ssthresh at the 18th transmission round. Because when the loss is detected by a triple duplicate ACK at 16th transmission round, the cwnd size is 42, so the ssthresh is the half of 42, namely 21.
    + g. 14 is the value of ssthresh at the 24th transmission round. Because when the loss is detected by a timeout at 22nd transmission round, the cwnd size is 29, so the ssthresh is the half of 29, namely 21(taking lower floor of (29/2)).
    + h. During 7th transmission round is the 70th segment sent. Because, 1+2+4+8+16+32=63<70, and 1+2+4+8+16+32+33=96>70.
    + i. The values of the congestion window size and of ssthresh are 7 and 4 respectively. Because when the loss is detected by a triple duplicate ACK at 26th transmission round, the cwnd size is 8. So, at 27th transmission round, the ssthresh is the 8/2=4, and the cwnd size is 4+3=7.
    + j. In this case, the ssthresh and the congestion window size at the 19th round are 21 and 4. Because when the loss is detected by a triple duplicate ACK at 16th transmission round, the cwnd size is 42, so the ssthresh is the half of 42, namely 21, and the state became to slow start at 17th transmission round. Hence, the cwnd is 1 at 17th round, is 2 at 18th round, is 4 at 19th round.
    + k. 52 packets have been sent out from 17th round till 22nd round, inclusive. Because the state would become to slow start at 17th round in this case, and ssthresh is 21. Hence, 17th round: 1 packet; 18th round: 2 packets; 19th round: 4 packets; 20th round: 8 packets; 21st round: 16 packets; 22th round: 21 packets; In total is 52 packets.



### Chapter 3 Problem 44

+ **question:**

    Consider sending a large file from a host to another over a TCP connection that has no loss.

    + a. Suppose TCP uses AIMD for its congestion control without slow start. Assuming cwnd increases by 1 MSS every time a batch of ACKs is received and assuming approximately constant round-trip times, how long does it take for cwnd increase from 6 MSS to 12 MSS (assuming no loss events)?
    + b. What is the average throughput (in terms of MSS and RTT) for this connection up through time = 6 RTT?

+ **Answer:**
  
    + a. (12 MSS - 6 MSS)/ (1 MSS/RTT)=6RTT
    + b. Throughput_avg=(1+2+3+4+5+6)MSS/6RTT=3.5MSS/RTT
