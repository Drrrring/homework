a . TCP slow start : [1,6] and [23,26].  
---
b . TCP congestion avoidance : [6,16] and [17,22].  
---
c . According to three redundant acks, if the timeout congestion window size decreases to 1.  
---
d . According to timeout detection, because the congestion window is set to 1.  
---
e . The initial value of ssthresh is 32.  
---
f . Packet loss, ssthresh is set to half of the congestion window,  
ssthresh is 42 at 16, and ssthresh is 21 at 18.  
---
g . The same of f, ssthresh is 28 at 22, and ssthresh is 14 at 24.  
---
h . During the first transmission cycle, packet 1 is sent; Second : packets 2-3;  
Third : packets 4-7; Fourth : packets 8-15; Fifth : packets 16-31; Sixth : packets 32-63;  
Seventh : packets 64-127; So the 70th message segment is in the seventh transmission cycle.  
---
i . The congestion window is set to 7, ssthresh = 4.  
---
j . The congestion window is set to 1, ssthresh = 21.  
---
k . 17--1 group; 18--2 groups; 19--4 groups; 20--8 groups; 21--16 groups; 22--21 groups;  
The all is 52 groups.

a . 1RTT increased to 7MSS; 2RTTs increased to 8MSS; 3RTTs increased to 9MSS;  
4RTTs increased to 10MSS; 5RTTs increased to 11MSS; 6RTTs increased to 12MSS.  
---
b . The sending time is 6RTTs, 67891011 = 51MSS  
So the average throughput of 6RTTs is (51MSS)/(6RTT) = 8.5MSS/RTT.
