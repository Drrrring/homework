## P40  
a. round0~6 and round23~26.   it grows exponentially
b. round6~16 and round17~22.   it grows linearly.  
c. a triple duplicate ACK. the cwnd grows linearly.  
d. timeout. the cwnd becomes 1 MSS and grows exponentially.  
e. 32. Since it arrives 32 cwnd, it begins grow linearly.  
f. 21. When it comes to a triple duplicate ACK, ssthresh becomes half.  
g. 14.5. When it comes to a timeout, ssthresh becomes half.   
h. the 7th. Before the 7th round, it has sent 63 segments. And the 7th round, it will send 33 segments. And the 70th segment is in them.  
i. The cwnd is 7MSS, and the ssthresh is 4.  
j. The ssthresh is 21, and the cwnd is 4Mss.  
h. The 17th round is 1segment, the 18th is 2segments, the 19th is 4segments ... the 21st is 16segments, the 22nd is 21segments. So the sum is 52segments.
