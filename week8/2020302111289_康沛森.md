>  <strong>P40</strong> Consider Figure 3.61. Assuming TCP Reno is the protocol experiencing the 
behavior shown above, answer the following questions. In all cases, you 
should provide a short discussion justifying your answer.<br>
a. Identify the intervals of time when TCP slow start is operating.<br>
b. Identify the intervals of time when TCP congestion avoidance is operating.<br>
c. After the 16th transmission round, is segment loss detected by a triple 
duplicate ACK or by a timeout?<br>
d. After the 22nd transmission round, is segment loss detected by a triple 
duplicate ACK or by a timeout?<br>
e. What is the initial value of ssthresh at the first transmission round?<br>
f. What is the value of ssthresh at the 18th transmission round?<br>
g. What is the value of ssthresh at the 24th transmission round?<br>
h. During what transmission round is the 70th segment sent?<br>
i. Assuming a packet loss is detected after the 26th round by the receipt of 
a triple duplicate ACK, what will be the values of the congestion window 
size and of ssthresh?<br>
j. Suppose TCP Tahoe is used (instead of TCP Reno), and assume that triple 
duplicate ACKs are received at the 16th round. What are the ssthresh
and the congestion window size at the 19th round?<br>
k. Again suppose TCP Tahoe is used, and there is a timeout event at 
22nd round. How many packets have been sent out from 17th round till 
22nd round, inclusive?<br><br>
<strong>
a. TCP慢启动的时间间隔为：1-6，23-26<br>
b. TCP拥塞避免的时间间隔为：6-16，17-22<br>
c. 根据3个冗余ACK检测出来的<br>
d. 根据超时检测出来的<br>
e. 第一个传输轮回ssthresh为32，是慢启动停止的窗口大小<br>
f. 分组丢失阈值变一半，16回合时为42，检测到丢失，故第十八个轮回为21<br>
g. 同上理第二十四个轮回为14<br>
h. 第一次发送1个，第二次2个，第三次4个，第四次8个，第五次16个，第六次32个，第七次64个，此时已经传完96个，故在第七个轮回发送70个报文<br>
i. 窗口长度为1，ssthresh为4<br>
j. 窗口长度为4，ssthresh为21<br>
k. 由j知，16轮回时发生了快速重传，但是没有快速恢复的情况，与图中的折线不同。应该是，第十七次1个，十八次2个，十九次4个，二十此8个，二一次16个，二十二次21个，共发送了52个分组。

><strong>P44</strong>Consider sending a large file from a host to another over a TCP connection 
that has no loss.<br>
a. Suppose TCP uses AIMD for its congestion control without slow start. 
Assuming cwnd increases by 1 MSS every time a batch of ACKs is 
received and assuming approximately constant round-trip times, how long 
does it take for cwnd increase from 6 MSS to 12 MSS (assuming no loss 
events)?<br>
b. What is the average throughput (in terms of MSS and RTT) for this connection up through time = 6 RTT?<br><br>

<strong>
a. 6RTT  。->7MSS->8MSS->9MSS->10MSS->11MSS->12MSS,共用6RTT<br>
b. 平均吞吐量8.5MSS 。（6+7+8+9+10+11）/6=8.5MSS <br>
